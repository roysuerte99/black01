/*
 * GPU configuration. You should play around with intensity and worksize as the fastest settings will vary.
 * index         - GPU index number usually starts from 0
 * intensity     - Number of parallel GPU threads (nothing to do with CPU threads)
 * worksize      - Number of local GPU threads (nothing to do with CPU threads)
 * affine_to_cpu - This will affine the thread to a CPU. This can make a GPU miner play along nicer with a CPU miner.
 * bfactor       - Enables running some kernel in smaller pieces.
 *                 0 or false = use a contiguous block of memory per thread
 * asm            - use gpu specific assembler code to perform the randomx kernel (supported for RX4XX, RX5XX, Vega and Radeon VII)
 * interleave    - Controls the starting point in time between two threads on the same GPU device relative to the last started thread.
 *                 This option has only an effect if two compute threads using the same GPU device: valid range [0;100]
 *                 0  = disable thread interleaving
 *                 40 = each working thread waits until 40% of the hash calculation of the previously started thread is finished
