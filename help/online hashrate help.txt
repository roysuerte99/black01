To see your hashrates on any device on your local network,
1. Win + R type cmd
2. type ipconfig
3. Under Ethernet/Wifi adapter copy your IPv4 Address
4. On a web browser paste that ip address and put :9999 at the end of it
5. eg. 10.0.32.64:9999

You can bookmark this website since your ip won't change unless you reset your network properties.
If your ip changes just redo above steps.

To change the port that the hashrate is shown on,
1. Open config.txt 
2. Find where it says "httpd_port" : 9999,
3. Change that number to any number, or make it 0 to turn off the server

Note turning off the server usually doesn't increase hashrates.

Also note that this only works on your local LAN network. If you want to check your hashrate
while you're outside your home, you will need to use port forwarding.
